# Overview

**First Steps** is my typical "Hello World" application.

This application is a console application that prints the famous "Hello World" message to the console.

The purpose that most developers and my self find ourselves creating this basic application is to test the development environment and the programming language.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
