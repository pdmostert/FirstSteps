# Overview

**First Steps** is my typical "Hello World" application.

This application is a console application that prints the famous "Hello World" message to the console.

The purpose why most developers and my self included find ourselves creating this basic application is to test the development environment and the programming language.
The questions we ask ourselves is "Does it build?", "Does it run?", "Is the output what I expected?".
